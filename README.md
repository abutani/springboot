# Coding Test
Our Application is largely configuration driven.  One of the configuration screens that was recently redesigned allowed us to configure which data sets are visible to which users.  I have provided a basic skeleton that renders a basic page and has stubbed out code to 
implement CRUD operations.  The data needs to be stored for different year/month time periods.  For example, Jan 2018 has a set of configs A,B,C,D.  However, Feb 2018 has the set of configs A,C,F,G,H. For convenience, you can use the string "022018" as Feb 2018 to avoid date code. 

### Minimum Requirements:
1. Display whatever is currently configured **(not having a configuration is not an error)** in a grid.
1. Add the ability to add new configurations for a time period.
1. Add the ability to delete all the configurations for a time period.

### Optional Requirements: 
1. Add the ability to remove a single configuration for a time period.
